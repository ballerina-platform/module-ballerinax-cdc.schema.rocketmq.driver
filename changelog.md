## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial release of `ballerinax/cdc.schema.rocketmq.driver` — bundles the required Java drivers for RocketMQ-backed CDC schema history storage.

### Changed
- Upgrade the bundled Debezium RocketMQ schema-history storage to 3.5.1.Final.
- Migrate to Ballerina Swan Lake Update 14 (2201.14.0) with Java 25 support.
- Ship the Netty 4.2.18.Final artifacts that `rocketmq-remoting` needs, instead of relying on Netty being supplied by another package at runtime ([#9152](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-library/issues/9152)).
- Upgrade gRPC to 1.84.2, whose `grpc-netty-shaded` bundles Netty 4.2, and protobuf-java to 3.25.9.
